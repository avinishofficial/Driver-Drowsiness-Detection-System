# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-System
The Driver Drowsiness Detection System, built with Python, uses computer vision (OpenCV, Dlib) to monitor facial features, identifying eye closures, yawning, and head movements. It calculates the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) to detect fatigue, triggering alerts to prevent accidents. Cost-effective and scalable, it enhances road safety.
